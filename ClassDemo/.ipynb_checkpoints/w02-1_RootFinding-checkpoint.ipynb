On each Newton iteration, we check to be sure that Newton hasn’t thrown us outside our starting interval. If it has not, then we continue to iterate to convergence. If the result of an iteration does fall outside our bracket, we revert to bisection to provide a closer initial guess before trying Newton iteration once again.\n",

In general, however, it *must* converge to the correct answer within reasonable tolerances. This makes it a good, general-purpose root-finder for one dimension.\n",
